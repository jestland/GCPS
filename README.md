# GCPS: A CNN Performance Evaluation Criterion for Radar Signal Intrapulse Modulation Recognition

GCPS (Grad-CAM Position Score) is a new criterion based on [Grad-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391) to evaluate CNN recognition performance in radar signal intrapulse modulation recognition.

This work will appear in IEEE Communications Letters.

## Denpendencies

1. [Deep learning toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html)
2. [tftb-0.2](http://tftb.nongnu.org/)
3. [make line better](https://github.com/davidkun/linspecer)
4. GPU is not necessary

We provide a radar signal dataset, you can also use tftb to generate by yourself.

## Update log

Ver1.0: Add basic code files and dataset.
